abstract = {In digital communication, a filter is any device that selectively attenuates any unwanted component from a received signal. It essentially changes or reshapes the waveform of a signal in the desired manner. In this work, we have designed and studied low pass filter using Rectangular, Bartlett, Hamming, Hanning, Tukey and Kaiser Window algorithms and compared them with each other for further analysis. The parameters we used for designing the filter are sampling frequency, cut off frequency, filter order and a variable parameter, α. MATLAB toolbox for DSP, namely FDA Tool and FV Tool were employed for the realization of the design.}

abstract = {This paper presents an overview on advancement made in designing of a digital infinite impulse response (IIR) filter. The design problem of an IIR filter was found to be challenging due to presence of poles in its transfer function. This makes the phase response of an IIR transfer function nonlinear and its magnitude response is also drifted due to quantization of coefficient values of denominator polynomials, which leads towards instability. Therefore, numerous efforts were made in order to acquire an optimal filter response using several optimization methods. Design problem of an IIR filter with various constraints was developed and solved using gradient based techniques, which resulted in optimal passband response with nearly linear phase or in some cases, absolute linearity was also achieved. However, the obtained solutions were sub-optimal in many cases due to transferring the multimodal design problem of an IIR filter into convex optimization. The solution was also affected due to the quantization of filter coefficients and in case of absolute linear phase response; a strong hick in magnitude response at beginning of transition edge frequency was obtained. To overcome the sub-optimality, researchers used evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for designing of an IIR filter. In time domain, system identification (SI) was adopted, whereas various error functions were developed in frequency domain for obtained magnitude responses close to desired response. This approach resulted in an optimal IIR filter response, however phase response linearity was not improved. Thus, EA approach was appropriated for lower order IIR filters. The design of various IIR filters like lowpass filter (LPF), highpass filter (HPF), bandpass filter (BPF) and bandstop filter (BSP) using an all-pass infinite impulse response (APF-IIR) was also reported. This approach is most appropriate, because the filter response is stable, nearly linear and magnitude response was also accurate. However, there is high error at the band edges of passband. Therefore, literature reveals that an APF based approach is most appropriate for various magnitude response filters.}

abstract = {An investigation on the low Reynolds number effect on hemispherical-tipped Pitot tube measurements was performed by measuring the center-line velocity during the laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid in a 25mm (1in.) diameter vertical recirculating pipe loop. The primary objective of the study was to reconsider the available low Reynolds number Pitot tube data in the literature with modern instrumentation. Using the results of this experimental study, a correlation that accurately predicts the low Reynolds number Pitot tube behavior has been developed. The correlation accounts for an additional viscous term in the relationship for the pressure coefficient (Cp) which is not accounted for in Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation is semi-empirical and accurately fits experimental data gathered in this study, as well as a significant body of experimental data available in the literature. The correlation, which is based on a Pitot tube Reynolds number calculated using the opening diameter (d), has been shown to be provide more accurate predictions of Cp for a wide range of opening diameter to outer diameter ratios (0.22≤d/D≤0.6) than available correlations based on outer diameter. The transition Pitot tube Reynolds number, below which Bernoulli's Equation is no longer appropriate, was predicted to be approximately 35, compared to a value of 79 obtained from fitting data collected by Barker. The correlation developed in this study provides smoother transitions at both ends of the low Reynolds range. At the low end (Re<10) it converges with a Stokes Law’ analogy, while at the critical transition (Re~35) it converges asymptotically with Bernoulli's Equation. The correlation also accurately predicts the behavior of the pressure coefficient with Reynolds numbers between these ranges.}

abstract = {A Pitot tube is a popular device used for the measurements of flow fields. To control the accuracy of the Pitot tube coefficient, the international standard organization (ISO), the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), and the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) issued guidelines that recommended the shape and working conditions of these devices. However, many Pitot tubes on the market do not follow these guidelines. In the present study, various types of Pitot tubes in the market were tested at the National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) to determine the effects of the geometry and flow characteristics. The results revealed certain limitations in the existing ISO and JIS standards, specifically with regard to the recommended design parameters of the AMCA Pitot tube, the reference coefficient value for the JIS Pitot tube, and the redefinition and limitation of Reynolds numbers pertaining to Pitot tube working conditions.}

abstract = {IIR digital filters are generally designed from an analog low-pass filter by any combination of the bilinear transformation, frequency transformation for analog filters and that for IIR digital filters. But the direct application of these transformations yields a complicated formula of the target transfer function, which has to be reduced by hand computation into the form of a rational polynomial. This hand computation will be replaced by an automatic procedure if the relation between the coefficients of the transfer functions is formulated. This paper derives the explicit formulae which connect those coefficients by matrices.
Zusammenfassung
Rekursive digitale Filter werden gewöhnlich von analogen Tiefpassfiltern abgeleitet. Dabei benutzt man sowohl bilineare Transformationen als auch Frequenztransformationen für analoge und rekursive digitale Filter. Diese Transformationen führen aber auf eine komplizierte Darstellung der gewünschten Übertragungsfunktion, die von Hand in eine rationale Funktion umgeformt werden muβ. Diese Umformung wird hier durch ein automatisches Verfahren ersetzt, falls die Verhältnisse zwischen den Koeffizienten der Übertragungsfunktion bekannt sind. Dieser Artikel leitet explizite Formeln her, die diese Koeffizienten durch Matrizen miteinander verbinden.
Résumé
Les filtres RII sont en général conçus à partir d'un filtre analogique passe-bas en combinant la transformée bilinéaire, la transformée en fréquence des filtres analogiques et celle des filtres RII numériques. Toutefois, l'application directe de ces transformations résulte en une formule compliquée pour la fonction de transfert recherchée, qui doit alors être réduite à la main à un polynome rationnel. Ce travail à la main peut être remplacé par une procédure automatique si la relation entre les coefficients des fonctions de transfert est formulée. Cet article dérive les formules explicites qui lient ces coefficients par des relations matricielles.}
